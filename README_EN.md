# 🌍 LINK: The First Algorithmic Democracy

## 🧪 The Experiment
**What if 1 million people redirected their daily coffee money ($3) to collectively vote on solving global problems?**

## 🔄 How It Works (Simple)
1. **Phase 0:** 1M people digitally commit
2. **Phase 1:** When we hit 1M → system auto-activates
3. **Phase 2:** $90M monthly flows to daily-voted solutions
4. **Phase 3:** Build Nexus Prime - first city governed by transparent algorithms

## 🎯 Core Principles
- 🔓 **Total transparency** (blockchain for everything)
- 👤 **Total anonymity** (no real names, just wallets)
- 📊 **Verifiable impact** (see exactly what your $3 did)
- ⚡ **Code is law** (smart contracts execute what's voted)

## 🛠️ We Need
- 🔧 **Developers** (Solidity, React, Node.js)
- 🎨 **Designers** (UI/UX for the app)
- 📝 **Writers** (clear documentation)
- 🌐 **Translators** (global accessibility)

## 💰 Zero Money Until 1M
This is NOT fundraising. It's commitment.
**No money changes hands until 1 million people sign.**

## 🚀 First Milestone: MVP in 30 Days
- [ ] Landing page with live counter
- [ ] Smart contract for commitments (no money yet)
- [ ] Basic voting simulation
- [ ] Transparent roadmap

## 🤝 How to Help (Anonymously)
1. Create anonymous GitHub account
2. Solve a challenge in `/issues`
3. Submit PR with your solution
4. Join encrypted chat

## ❌ This is NOT
- A charity
- A political party
- A utopian dream
- Get-rich-quick scheme

## ✅ This IS
- Open-source experiment in human coordination
- Test of whether transparency beats corruption
- Bet that 1M ordinary people can out-govern politicians

## 📍 Start Here
- **Non-technical:** Read `/docs/vision.md`
- **Developer:** Check `/issues` for challenges
- **Curious:** Explainer video (coming soon)

## ❓ The Question
**"Can 1 million strangers coordinate transparently to solve problems governments can't?"**
